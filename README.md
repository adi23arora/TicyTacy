#Ticy Tacy

Ticy Tacy is a variation on the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. 

If you are not familiar with Tic-Tac-Toe it a game where two player take turns claiming cells in a square grid until one player has a complete row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

The problem with these rules is that in a standard 3x3 game board players run out of unclaimed board spaces before someone has won the game. 

Ticy Tacy attempts to solve this problem by making it so players can only claim three cells at a time. If a player already has three cells claimed then they must first release their claim on one of their cells before they can claim a new cell.
